CS2 Enigma
==========

Sample Configuration Files and A Small Testsuite
================================================

To run the testsuite, in this directory run:

./tests.hs

This will only work if your compiled file is called 'enigma'.
Note that this is the name the automated tester will expect as well.

There are sample rotor configuration files in rotors/
and plugboard configuration files in plugboards/

There is also a completely optional, unassessed challenge in challenge/
