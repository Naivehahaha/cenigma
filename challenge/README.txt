The Enigma Decryption Challenge
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

It is January 1944. Much of Europe lies in German hands.
The Battle of Briton is long over and Allied forces amass 
in England preparing to go on the offensive. On the Eastern 
front, German forces are slowly losing ground to the Russian 
Army.
 
However, away from the front-lines near the bustling city of
Vitsyebsk in Belarus, suspicious troop movements and supply
orders have come to the attention of a covert British special 
forces unit. At great cost the unit has been able to intercept 
a series of radio messages from the town and send them back
to England. It is your job to decode these transmissions to 
provide vital intelligence for the Allied high command.

A log of recent transmissions is provided in the file
transmission-log.txt. It is your job to decode these
transmissions. To help you with this task you have been 
provided with a page from a codebook that was acquired by 
British special forces in a recent operation. This can be 
found in the file codebook.txt.

The first student, or group of students, to e-mail a
fully translated series of communications, along with an 
explanation of how they produced them, to
mjw03@doc.ic.ac.uk will win the decryption challenge.

Hints:

> You may assume that the messages have all been sent 
  in English.

> It is likely that you will need to implement some
  extensions to your enigma machine program.
